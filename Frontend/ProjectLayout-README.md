-   Each component (a individual edu sharing component like workspace, recycle, collections...) has to be placed under "modules"
    It needs the following files
    declarations.ts -> Contains all Declarations of components, the exported var name should be DECLARATIONS_MODULENAME
    providers.ts -> Contains all Declarations of services (if it has any), the exported var name should be PROVIDERS_MODULENAME
    routes.ts -> Contains all routes for this module, the exported var name should be ROUTES_MODULENAME
    The following files have to be changed after a component is added:
    app.module.ts -> Import the DECLARATIONS_MODULENAME and PROVIDERS_MODULENAME
    router/router.component.ts -> Add the ROUTES_MODULENAME to the routes list
